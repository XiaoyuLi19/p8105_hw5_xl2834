# Problem 2

``` r
sim_mean_p = function(n = 30, mu = 0, sigma = 5) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma),
  )

    )
}


sim_results = 
  rerun(50, sim_mean_p(30, 0, 5)) %>% 
  bind_rows()
```

Repeat for mu = 1 to 6

``` r
mu_list = 
  list(
    "mu_1"  = 1, 
    "mu_2"  = 2, 
    "mu_3" = 3,

for (i in 1:6) {
  output[[i]] = rerun(50, sim_mean_p(mu = mu_list[[i]])) %>%

```

Build a dataset

``` r
result_df =
  tibble(
  mu = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = mu, ~ rerun(50, sim_mean_p(mu = .x))),
    estimate_df = map(output_lists, bind_rows)
  ) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_df)
```

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the
power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis.
Describe the association between effect size and power.

``` r
sim = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 0, sd = 5),
  )

sim %>% 
    summarize(
      mu_hat = mean(x),
      sigma_hat = sd(x)
    )
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2
    ##   mu_hat sigma_hat
    ##    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1  0.223      4.41

``` r
broom::tidy(t.test(rnorm(n = 30, mean = 0, sd = 5), mu = 0))$p.value
