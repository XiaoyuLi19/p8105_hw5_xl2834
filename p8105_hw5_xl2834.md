## Problem 1

``` r
file_path = 
  list.files(path = "./data/hw5_data/data", full.names = TRUE)



read_data = function(x) {
  
  
  
  study_df = read_csv(x) %>% 
             mutate(arm_id = str_sub(x, start = -10, end = -5))
  
  
  study_df
  
  
}

output = vector("list", length = 10)

for (i in 1:10) {
  output[[i]] = read_data(file_path[[i]])
