## Problem 1

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided

Try to iterate ……..

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

``` r
file_path = 
  list.files(path = "./data/hw5_data/data", full.names = TRUE)



read_data = function(x) {
  
  study_df = read_csv(x) %>% 
             mutate(arm_id = str_sub(x, start = -10, end = -5))

output_1 = vector("list", length = 10)

weeks.

# Problem 3

    )
}


sim_results =

```

Repeat for mu = 0 to 6

Build a dataset

) %>%

Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was rejected (the
power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of μ on the x axis.
Describe the association between effect size and power.

``` r
reject_df = 
  result_df %>% 
  mutate(
    reject_null = case_when(
      p_value < 0.05 ~ "rejected",
      p_value >= 0.05 ~ "failed to reject"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(mu, reject_null) %>% 
  group_by(mu) %>% 
  summarize(
    reject_total = sum(reject_null == "rejected")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(reject_proportion = reject_total / 5000)
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

The higher the mu value, the higher the proporiton of times that null is
rejected. This indicates that a larger effect size can lead to higher
power.

Make a plot showing the average estimate of μ hat on the y axis and the
true value of μ on the x axis.

``` r
plot_2 =
  result_df %>% 
  group_by(mu) %>% 
  summarize(avg_mu_hat = mean(mu_hat)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = avg_mu_hat)) +
  geom_point() +
  
  labs(
    title = "mean mu hat in groups with different mu")
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Make a second plot (or overlay on the first) the average estimate of μ
hat only in samples for which the null was rejected on the y axis and
the true value of μ on the x axis.

``` r
plot_3 = 
  result_df %>% 
  mutate(
    reject_null = case_when(
      p_value < 0.05 ~ "rejected",
      p_value >= 0.05 ~ "failed to reject"
    )
  ) %>%
  filter(reject_null == "rejected") %>% 
  group_by(mu) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mu_hat = mean(mu_hat)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = mean_mu_hat)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "mean mu hat in samples where null was rejected")
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
plot_2 + plot_3
```

<img src="p8105_hw5_xl2834_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="90%" />

With the increase of μ, the effect size increases, and power increases.
The sample average of μ hat across tests for which the null is rejected
approximately equal to the true value of μ when μ = 0, 4, 5, 6, and is
not approximately equal when μ = 1, 2, 3. When μ = 0, the sample with
rejected null lie in both tails of the distribution (both positive side
and negative side), so the average of the sample is close to 0. When μ =
1, 2, 3, the sample with rejected null lie primarily in the upper tail,
so the average is larger than the true value of μ. When μ = 4,5,6,
almost all samples have rejected null, so the average is close to true
value of μ.
